# Learning Process Walkthrough

## Way of Thinking

**What is the main problem in becoming good hacker?**

> Sheer volume of information. Deep understanding of a wide variety of technologies is required.

**What skill you need to obtain?**

> Learn how to find, choose and adapt the information we need.

**How to learn effectively?**

> Active Recall Framework
> Work on learning process
> Holistic approach
> Spaced Repetition System
> Active Learning vs Passive Learning

## Think Outside the Box

**What's hacker way of thinking?**

> Outside the box.

## Occam's Razor

**What's Occam's Razor central principle?**

> The most straightforward theory is preferable to all others of several sufficient possible explanations for the same state of facts.
> In other words: The simplest explanation is always the most probable.

**What should you focus on when learning new topics?**

> Concept is crucial. Rephrase what you've learnt. Make it your own.

**What's best approach to penetration testing process?**

> You work with the information you get.

## Talent

**What is talent in essence?**

> Trained and adapted thought process and the associated thought patterns for specific fields and situations.

## Way of Learning

**What is a problem?**

> A problem is an emotional state. Without emotions, it is just a situation.

> Work on emotional state --> improve learning process.

## Learning Efficiency

**How should you build experience?**

> Trials and errors.

> Define what you know and don't know.

> Failure is a most important part of learning process.

> Experience is built on failures.

**How you should optimize your learning?**

> Reach for 80% of the effects with 20% of the efforts. (Pareto Principle)

## Learning Types

**How to absorb more information?**

> Discuss
> Explain
> Repeat
> Rephrase

**How to measure progress?**

> Progress is noticeable when the question that tortured you has lost its meaning.

**How to develop your skillset?**

> Use your experiences to build a konwledgebase. Learn by associatons. Create repertoire by practicing.

## The Brain

**How to master your brain?**

> Optimize processes
> Cognitive Science
> Experiment and explore
> Science-based tools

**What should your thought, speech and writing be?**

> Clear, precise and simple.

**What is consciousness?**

> Consciousness describes the totality of all those mental processes by which we become aware of the external and our internal world with active observation.
> Therefore, when we actively observe that we are looking at a monitor full of text and can decide to change the situation if necessary and intentionally look elsewhere,
> we are in consciousness.

**How will you leverage subconscuious?**

> We process far more thoughts subconsciously than consciously.

> Leverage your subconscious by being honset with yourself.

> Build an intuition.

> Use your emotions as a guide to your internal state.

## The Will

**What's the role of the will on your thinking process?**

> Psychology --> Transformation of decisions into conscious and deliberate actions.

> Philosophy --> What is in us, we have no idea until we start trying hard.

> Whether you think you can or you think you can't. You're right.

## The Goal

**What is your goal?**

> Become a better human being.

> Think, say and write as many true statements as possible.

> Be my harshest critic.

> If people don't think I'm crazy. My dream is not big enough.

> It's time to take some fucking souls!

## Decision Making

**What is decision making?**

> Circumstances based reasoning.

**A train speeds unbraked toward a group of five-track workers.
The switchman might divert the train to a siding where only one person is working.
Should he sacrifice one person to save five others?**

> Having only two options is very limiting and does not reflect real world scenarios.

> Do not let someone else limitations become your own.

> Consider your limitations through First Principles. Break down the situation to its most fundamental parts that you know are true.
> Bypass limitations put on you by others.

**What's First Principles Thinking?**

> It's a process of deconstructing the situation to it's most essential parts, where only most foundational truths are left.

> Cartesian Doubt --> Systematically doubt everything that could possibly be doubted, until you're left with purely indubitable truths.

## Documentation

**What is a purpose of documentation?**

> Present information in comprehensible and easy to reproduce way.

> Essential characteristics:

> 1. Overview
> 2. Structure
> 3. Clarity

**What are the guidelines for writing good documentation?**

> 1. It is beneficial to put ourselves in the position of our readers. This will make it much easier for us to design the documentation.

> 2. Avoid repetition and ambiguity.

> 3. Make documentation as easy to read as possible. No one wants to read the documentation that is difficult to understand or follow.

## Organization

**What's the role of organization in penetration testing?**

> Penetration testing reports has to be structured.

> An **inexperienced** woodcutter take 30 minutes to sharpen his axe and 3 hours to cut down the tree.
> The **experienced** one will sharpen the axe for 3 hours and cut down the tree within 30 minutes.

**Name some of management techniques and methods...**

> - Scrum
> - Agile
> - ToDo-List
> - Bullet Journal

## Focus

**Why further physical effort can help you calm down?**

> You cannot win the battle against your mind with your mind.

> Use your body to conquer the mind.

> Strong and healty body, gives you a healthy mind.

> Hard training forces you to focus on activity.

> When you turn away your focus from stressfull situations.

> Your mind starts to let go...

> Use that moment to take over control of the situation. Refocus and keep attacking!

**What is focus?**

> Purposeful and deliberate alignment to a specific goal.

## Attention

**What is attention?**

> It's the perception of a specific topic. That's why:

> - it changes depending on our experience, gained information and their clarity,
> - can be influenced by: interests, needs, personal attitudes, beliefs, orientations, goals and experiences,
> - fluctuates over periods of time.

**What should you do to take full advantage of your attention?**

> Attention is a limited resource.

> Decreased attention leads to decreased absorbtion of information.

> Experiment with your attention span.

> Improve deliberate practice protocol.

> Things to investigate:

> - current emotional state (calm, nervous, worried, happy, depressed, relaxed, etc.)
> - the previous flow of the day so far
> - place of work
> - working hours
> - duration
> - sleep
> - inserted breaks
> - duration of breaks
> - music / flow state ?
> - do not force yourself
> - be patient
> - feel comfortable and ready to learn new things

## Comfort

**Yerkes-Dodson law**

**Comfort Zone**

<Image src="/assets/comfort-zone.png" width={2576} height={2068} />> Source: https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/9/section/54

Those who decide to leave their comfort zone will reach their destination faster.

## Obstacles

**Thoughts on fear...**

> People fear what might happen in the future while not considering the present.

> The difference between a winner and a loser is that the winner has lost more often than the loser.

**What is mindset?**

> Thought processes we unconsciously acquire to avoid difficult situations or efforts.

> I cannot do this "yet". --> Creates mindset that it's only temporary state.

> Talent --> strongly developed skill with high efficiency.

> Skill --> ability to manage or solve something well.

> Passion --> emotional commitment.

**How would you divide pressure sources?**

> Internal --> beliefs, mindset, attitude

> External --> Only the person who has taken the exact same journey as you can evaluate you and your decisions.
> Everything else is only assumptions.

## Questioning

**What's the prupose of a question?**

> To gather information and facts from wchich we can draw conclusions and make assumptions that will guide our decisions and thus our future course of action.

> Used for orientation.

> Get an overview of the situation.

**What's the most difficult thing in any situation?**

> Do not search for the right answer. Search for the right question.

**How can you improve asking questions?**

Pick 3 quetions:

> How do I start a Tesla car?

> How to improve your focus?

> How to write a good penetration test report?

How should I decide if the question is good? What does it mean "good" or "bad"?

> States "good" and "bad" are just attributes describing profit or loss you expect to get from an answer.

Two basic distinctions of a question are:

> Rough question --> "How can I hack X?"

> Precise question --> "How can I use the server's SMB service to identify its existing user acoount?"

Example of most prevalent learning process methodology:

> I want to open a lock.

> Question: How do we open the lock?

If it's a standard door lock, this question is unnecessary. We can use the tool called "key".

This situation looks a lot different if we have a vault in front of us that requires a combination of numbers.

**How can we modify questions we ask to get aswers that provide us with tools and methods we need to open the lock?**

> Once we know the goal (`The Goal`)

> to which we are attracted (`Willingness`)

> we use principles to develop talents (`Talent`)

> and make decisions (`Decision Making`)

> to pass the obstacles by asking the right questions (`Questioning`).

### Relationship Oriented Questioning (ROQ)

**What all our questions have in common?**

<Image src="/assets/questioning1.png" width={1301} height={859} />> Source: https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/9/section/1583

Model consist of five components:

| Component         | Description                                                                                         |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Your Position     | Position we are in and our view.                                                                    |
| The Object        | Core element of the question. The main component of our sentence takes meaning out of the question. |
| Known             | This information is known to us.                                                                    |
| Unknown           | This information is not known to us.                                                                |
| Other Position(s) | This component describes position of other persons.                                                 |

We want model to be universal -> ask any question correctly

> 1. Find core element of the question and insert it as the object.
> 2. You need to use at least 2 components out of five.

One component is always given in all questions:

> Your position in the question.

**What are all the methods available to remotely access Windows operating systems?**

Putting it inside `ROQ` model we get:

| Component         | Question Part | Description                                                                                         |
| ----------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Your Position     |               | Position we are in and our view.                                                                    |
| The Object        | Windows       | Core element of the question. The main component of our sentence takes meaning out of the question. |
| Known             | Methods       | This information is known to us.                                                                    |
| Unknown           | Methods       | This information is not known to us.                                                                |
| Other Position(s) |               | This component describes position of other persons.                                                 |

Lines represent relationship between components:

- `Solid line`: Connection - How is X connected to Y?
- `Dashed line`: Affection - How does Y influence the state of component X?

### Connecting components

Always start with the object relationships.

**What is the purpose for us to use Windows?**

> Use its functions to solve our tasks -> To operate on it.

**How does Windows influence our state in our position?**

> Windows provides us with functionality to use our computer.

**What must Windows do or offer to be managed by romote access methods?**

> A service must allow remote access over the Internet or network. Examples of such tools are `WinRM, Remote Desktop`. We can call this connection `Listening Service`.

**How do the remote access methods affect Windows and thus change the state of Windows? What do these methods provide us with?**

> Remote Access

<Image src="/assets/questioning4.png" width={1330} height={930} />> Source: https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/9/section/1583

**What is the purpose of remote access methods?**

> To use computer in different ways remotely.

**How do the different remote access methods that we know affect us?**

> They allow us to interact with Windows.

<Image src="/assets/questioning5.png" width={1355} height={928} />> Source: https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/9/section/1583

**Which services must Windows have running to use methods unknown to us?**

> We cannot know this because this methods are unknown to us. Therefore we name it like this: `???`

\*\*How do the remote access methods affect Windows and thus change the state of Windows? What do these methods offer to us?

> Purpose of known and unknown methods is the same -> Remote Access.

---

<Image src="/assets/questioning6.png" width={1321} height={929} />> Source: https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/9/section/1583

Knowing relationships between components allows us to be much more precise in defining information we should be focusing on. In this case, we should take a closer look at
all possible `Windows services` to find unknown methods that allow remote access.

This model is stackable, so you can convert things that are unknown into known.
