# Introduction to Networking Walkthrough

## Networking Overview

**What is the role of a network?**

> To enable communication between computers.

> In order to facilitate a network we use variety of `topologies`, `mediums` and `protocols`.

**What's characteristic of a flat network?**

> Not extremely difficult.

> Not very secure.

**How can we improve network security?**

> Creating lots of smaller networks can build up a defense layers.

> Pivoting around network is not difficult, but being quick and quiet is though.

> Forcing attacker to pivot, slows him down.

**How would you describe Access Control List?**

> It's a method for creating specific entry and exit points.

> It's similar to having an fence around your property.

> You can still jump over the fence, but it's unusual activity that can be quickly detected
> as malicious activity.

**Why would you take time to document network purpose?**

> Clarity. If you know what's the purpose then you can see if someone is misusing the network.

**How would you describe Intrusion Detection Systems?**

> This tools are deterrent to running network scans.

**How would you describe a process of communicating your laptop with company's network?**

> Internet is based on many smaller networks connected to each other.

> We can have "home" network that is built from all devices that are connected to the internet.

> At work we have another network built from all devices connected to it.

> Communication between networks works in similar way to post office.

> We sent different packets of data to different locations.

> In order to send data between "home" and "work" we need to know an address.

> On internet address is represented by `Uniform Resource Locator (URL)`.

> Another way of describing an address on the internet is `Fuly Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)`.

The difference between those two is specifity:

- FQDN (www.hackthebox.com) - address of the building (general)

- URL (https://www.hackthebox.eu/example?floor=2&office=dev&employee=17) - detailed address
  with floor, office, room number and the crresponding person we should find there (specific)

**What's the role of router & ISP**

> Router is like our local post office. It forwards our packets to the main post office (Internet Service Provider). Main post office (ISP) uses
> address register (Domain Name Service) to then convert address to geographical coordinates (IP address).

Address is like URL (I may know the address and still don't know where to go)

IP address is like geolocation - exatcly where it is on "planet" called Internet.

When we know exact location (IP address) we send our packet through our distribution network (main post office/ISP).

Host web server receives packet with request and sends us packet back with the data via post office (router) to the specified return address (my IP address).

### Key Points

Company network should consist of a least five separate networks!

- The Web Server should be in a DMZ (Demilitarized Zone). Clients on the internet can communicate with the server, which is an easy access point to entire network.
Placing server on separate network allows administrators to put networking protections between the web server and other devices.

- Workstations should be on their own network. Best case scenario - each workstation have a Host-Based Firewall rule preventing it from talking to other workstations.

- Putting workstations and servers on the same network, allows networking attacks like `spoofing` or `man in the middle`.

- Switch and router should be put on an "Administration Network". The main goal is to prevent workstations from snooping in on any communication between these devices.

- `OSPF` (Open Shortest Path First) -  this is a routing protocol for Internet Protocol (IP) networks. If router does not have a trusted network, anyone on the internal network
will be able to send malicious advertisement and perform `man in the middle` attack.

- IP Phones should be on their own network. It will prevent computers from eavesdropping on communication. Separate network is also recommended to prioritize traffic.
This will result in lower latency (smaller lag). 

- Printers should be on separate network. Securing printer is very difficult. For Windows, when printer tells computer authentication is required during a print job,
that computer will attempt `NTLMv2` authentication, which allows for stealing passwords. Printers are also very persistent and usually process tons of sensitive information.

**Things to avoid with printers:**

- Printers should not be able to talk to the internet.

- Workstation should not have been able to communicate to the printer over prot 445

- Printer should not be able to initiate connections to workstations. In some cases, printer/scanner combinations should be able to communicate to a mail server to email scanned
documents.

## Network Types

**What are `types` and `topologies`?**

> Networks have different structures and set ups. For this reason we use `types` and `topologies` to categorize them.

**What are most common network types?**

|Network Type | Definition |
| ---- | ----- |
| Wide Area Network (WAN) | Internet |
| Local Area Network (LAN) | Internal Networks (Ex: Home or Office) |
| Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) | Internal Networks accessible over Wi-Fi |
| Virtual Private Network (VPN) | Connects multiple network sites to one `LAN` |

**Describe WAN Network**

> WAN is commonly referred as `The Internet`. In networking we often have WAN and LAN addresses. WAN address is generally accessed by the Internet. WAN is not only limited to
> the internet. It's just a large number of LAN's joined together. Large companies or government agencies will have an "Internal WAN" (Intranet). To identify if the network is
> a WAN network, we should use a WAN Specific routing protocol (BGP). IP Schema should not be within RFC 1918 (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16).

**Describe LAN/WLAN Network**

> LAN's (Local Area Network) and WLAN's (Wireless Local Area Network) typically assign IP Addresses designated for local use. 
> Assigning routable IP Address is much less common, but possible.

> Only difference between LAN or WLAN is the ability to transmit data without cables. This may be important security wise.

**Describe VPN Network**

> There are three main types of Virtual Private Networks (VPN): 

> - `Site-To-Site VPN` - Both client and server are Network Devices. They share entire network ranges. This is most commonly used to join company networks together
> over the Internet. Multiple locations communicate over the Internet as if they were local.

> - `Remote Access VPN` - Computer create virtual interface that bahaves as if it is on a client's network. Common example is `OpenVPN`. Important piece of these types of VPN's
> is routing table which is created when joining VPN. When VPN only creates routes for specific network this is called `split-tunnel VPN`. In this case Internet connection is 
> not going out of the VPN.

> - `SSL VPN` - VPN done within web browser. It streams applications to your web browser. 

**Describe GAN Network**

> Global Area Network (GAN) - worldwide network (the Internet). Some international companies also maintain isolated networks that span several `WAN`s. It uses glass fiber
> infractructure to create wide-area network and then interconnects them by international undersea cables or satellite transmission.

**Describe MAN Network**

> Metropolian Area Network (MAN) - broadband telecommunications network that connects several LAN's in geographical proximity. It uses high-performance connections allowing for
> significantly higher data throughput than the Internet. Transmission speed should be comparable to LAN.

> Multiple MANs can be integrated into WAN and then intgrated further to GAN.

**Describe PAN/WPAN Network**

> Personal Area Network (PAN) / Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN) - it's a form of ad hoc network between two modern devices to enable data exchange. 
> Wireless version is based on Bluetooth or Wireless USB technologies. Network established via Bluetooth is called `Piconet`. These networks ususally extend only a few meters.
> They are not suitable for connecting devices in separate buildings or even rooms.

> WPAN's are used to control and monitor applications with low data rates. For home devices commonly used protocols are: `Insteon`, `Z-Wave`, `ZigBee`.

## Networking Topologies

**What is a topology?**

> Arrangement both physical and logical of devices in a network. 

All topologies include:

> Hosts - end-users that are actively using the network (clients, servers).

> Network Components - elements (routers, switches, bridges) responsible for distribution of communication. They allow logical connection between hosts.

**What is `transmission medium layout`?**

> Plan to connect physical devices of the network. Cables, positon of nodes and connections between them are all part of transmission medium layout.

> `Logical topology` - describes how signals act on the network and how data is transmitted across physical devices.

Connections can be divided into three areas:

|Wired connections | Wireless connections |
| ---- | ---- |
| Coaxial cabling | Wi-Fi |
| Glass fiber cabling | Cellular |
| Twisted-pair cabling | Satellite |
| and others | and others |

Nodes network components can be divided into:

|||||
|---|---|---|---|
| Repeaters | Hubs | Bridges | Switches |
| Router/Modem | Gateways | Firewalls |

Nodes are connection points to transmitters and receivers of electrical, optical or radio signals in the medium.

**Describe basic types of network topologies.**

### Point-to-Point

Simplest topology. Physical link exists only between `two hosts`. It enables mutual communication.

It's basic model for traditional telephon networks. It should not be confused with `P2P (Peer-to-Peer)` architecture.

### Bus 

All host connected via transmission medium (cabel). Every host has access to signals transmitted
over it. There is no central component that controls processes on it.

In this model **only one host sends data**, the rest receive and evaluate if data was intended for them.

### Star 

In this model we have a central network component (router, hub or switch) that is connected to all hosts.
Each host is connected via separate link. Component role is to forward data packets to its destination.
It receives data and then forwards it to destination (acts like middleware).

### Ring 

Physical ring connects each host with two cabels:

- one for `incoming` signals
- the other for `outgoing` signals

Control and access over this type of network are regulated by a protocol to which all stations adhere.

`Logical` ring topology is based on a physical star topology, where distributor simulates ring.

### Mesh 

In a fully meshed structure each host is connected to every other host in the network.

This technique is used for `WAN` and `MAN` networks to ensure high reliability and bandwidth.

Each node has the same routing functions and knows the neighboring nodes.

In the `partially meshed structure`, the endpoints are connected by only one connection.

### Hybrid 

Mix of at least two different standard topologies.

### Daisy Chain 

Multiple hosts connected by a cable from one node to another. It creates series of connections (chain) between hardware.
Popular in automation technology. This type of connection is dependant on physical arrangement.

## Proxies

**What is a proxy?**

It's a device or service that sits in the middle of a connection and acts as a mediator.
Devices like that have to be able to inspect the contents of the traffic. Without it,
device would be called `gateway`.

Proxies almost always operate at Layer 7 of the OSI Model. Most common proxy types are:

- `Dedicated Proxy / Forward Proxy`
- `Reverse Proxy`
- `Transparent Proxy`

**What is forward proxy?**

Client makes a request to a computer and that computer carries out the request.

For example, in corporate network, sensitive computers may not have direct access to the Internet.
So to access a website we have to go through a proxy (web filter).

**What is a reverse proxy?**

Forward proxy filters outgoing requests through network.

Reverse proxy filters incoming requests.

CloudFlare is a good example of reverse proxy. It is used to filter the amount (and type) of traffic
that gets sent to the webservers.

Penetration Testers will configure reverse proxies on infected endpoint. This is useful to bypass
firewalls or evade logging.

Another common reverse proxy examples is `ModSecurity`.
