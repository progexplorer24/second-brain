# Introduction to Networking Walkthrough

## Networking Overview

**What is the role of a network?**

> To enable communication between computers.

> In order to facilitate a network we use variety of `topologies`, `mediums` and `protocols`.

**What's characteristic of a flat network?**

> Not extremely difficult.

> Not very secure.

**How can we improve network security?**

> Creating lots of smaller networks can build up a defense layers.

> Pivoting around network is not difficult, but being quick and quiet is though.

> Forcing attacker to pivot, slows him down.

**How would you describe Access Control List?**

> It's a method for creating specific entry and exit points.

> It's similar to having an fence around your property.

> You can still jump over the fence, but it's unusual activity that can be quickly detected
> as malicious activity.

**Why would you take time to document network purpose?**

> Clarity. If you know what's the purpose then you can see if someone is misusing the network.

**How would you describe Intrusion Detection Systems?**

> This tools are deterrent to running network scans.

**How would you describe a process of communicating your laptop with company's network?**

> Internet is based on many smaller networks connected to each other.

> We can have "home" network that is built from all devices that are connected to the internet.

> At work we have another network built from all devices connected to it.

> Communication between networks works in similar way to post office.

> We sent different packets of data to different locations.

> In order to send data between "home" and "work" we need to know an address.

> On internet address is represented by `Uniform Resource Locator (URL)`.

> Another way of describing an address on the internet is `Fuly Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)`.

The difference between those two is specifity:

- FQDN (www.hackthebox.com) - address of the building (general)

- URL (https://www.hackthebox.eu/example?floor=2&office=dev&employee=17) - detailed address
with floor, office, room number and the crresponding person we should find there (specific)
